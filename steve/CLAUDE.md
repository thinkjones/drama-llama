# CLAUDE.md — AgentArmor Mod

Guidance for Claude Code when helping a **kid at Camp Drama Llama** modify this
Minecraft mod. Read this fully before making changes.

## Audience & tone
- The user is a **child (roughly 8–14)** in a 3-hour workshop, often making
  their first-ever code change. They may not know programming terms.
- Explain what you're doing in **plain, friendly language**. Avoid jargon; when
  you must use a term (like "durability"), define it in one short sentence.
- Keep changes **small and reversible**. Prefer one clear change at a time.
- After each edit, tell them what to run next and what they should see.
- Be encouraging. Celebrate their ideas. 🦙

## What this mod is
- **Minecraft 1.20.1**, **Forge** (`forge_version=47.2.0` in `gradle.properties`).
- Adds an **Agent Armor** set: helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots.
- Language: **Java 17**. Build tool: **Gradle** (via `./gradlew`).

## Common changes (and exactly where to make them)
| Kid asks to...                    | Change this                                              |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Make armor stronger/weaker        | protection `Map` values in `ModArmorMaterials.java`      |
| Change durability (how long it lasts) | `durabilityMultiplier` (the `37`) in `ModArmorMaterials.java` |
| Change what repairs it            | `Ingredient.of(Items.DIAMOND)` in `ModArmorMaterials.java` |
| Change the equip sound            | `SoundEvents.ARMOR_EQUIP_NETHERITE` in `ModArmorMaterials.java` |
| Change the welcome message/title  | the `Component.literal(...)` lines in `WelcomeHandler.java`  |
| Change the join sound             | `SoundEvents.PLAYER_LEVELUP` in `WelcomeHandler.java`       |
| Stop auto-giving the armor        | delete the `if (...) { giveItem(...) }` block in `WelcomeHandler.java` |
| Change the HQ blocks / size       | the palette + size constants at the top of `HeadquartersBuilder.java` |
| Change the giant sign text        | the `drawText(...)` calls in `HeadquartersBuilder.buildSign` (add letters to `FONT` if needed) |
| Rebuild the HQ in a test world    | it builds once (a hidden bedrock marker guards it); break that block or use a fresh world to rebuild |
| Rename the armor (display)        | `assets/agentarmor/lang/en_us.json`                     |
| Rename the mod id (advanced)      | `mod_id` in `gradle.properties` + folder/asset names + `mods.toml` — do this carefully and explain the ripple effects |
| Change icon/armor color           | the `.png` files under `textures/` (regenerate placeholders) |

## Build & test commands
- Build the mod jar: `./gradlew build`  → output in `build/libs/`.
- Launch test Minecraft: `./gradlew runClient` (creative → Combat tab).
- **First run downloads Minecraft + Forge (~minutes).** Warn the kid it's slow
  the first time, not broken.

## Guardrails
- Do **not** rename packages, `mod_id`, or asset folders unless the kid clearly
  asks to rename the mod — and if so, change **every** matching place so it
  still builds, then explain what you touched.
- Keep `mods.toml` `modId`, `gradle.properties` `mod_id`, and the
  `assets/agentarmor/` folder name **in sync** — they must all match.
- If a build error appears, read it, explain the cause simply, and fix the
  root cause. Don't guess repeatedly — see `.claude/agents/minecraft-modder.md`.
- Never delete the kid's work without asking.
